            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all the ſects that have troubled the Church of Chriſt, there is none that have heapt up ſuch a multitude of errours, and made ſuch a vexatious ſtir for them in the world, by ſubtilty, importunity, flames and blood-ſhed, as the Papiſts have done. Where they dare do it, they cruelly torment, and bloodily murder thoſe that are not of their errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind: Yea, its part of their Religion to force all Chriſtian Princes to deſtroy us; and if they will not, to abſolve their ſubjects from their allegiance, and deliver up their Countries to a Papiſt that will deſtroy us. For this is the Decree of one of their undoubted Councils, <hi>Later. ſub Innoc.</hi> 3. <hi>Can.</hi> 3. And where they cannot or dare not do this, they are buſie day and night to deceive; turning themſelves into the ſhape of various Sects, and creeping in among both rich and poor, but ſpecially inſinuating into Rulers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, that may do them the greateſt ſervice when they are ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And their ordinary way is to ſeek firſt to unſettle men, and make them doubt of their former profeſſion, and bring them into diſlike with their Teachers, and ſo to win them over to themſelves. To which end, their common cry is, that we are of a new Religion, that we are Hereticks, that we are a ſmall Party, and divided all to pieces among our ſelves, and that we are but loſt in wandering and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all becauſe we have left the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the true Catholick Apoſtolick Church, and which all our fore-fathers lived and dyed in, and which is the Center and Head of unity, and the only judge of controverſies, for want of whoſe infallible deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every man interpreting Scriptures as he pleaſe, and being a Pope to himſelf, we are ſo many men, ſo many minds, and all out of the way, and ſhall never be right till we return to the Pope. Here's a fair and plauſible tale, that may catch the ſimple, that know not what the Church or Religion is, and may ſhake thoſe that never
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170148:3"/>built upon the Rock. Like the words of the Harlot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.15. to 20. &amp; 5.3. to 15. &amp; 7. &amp; 9.15, 16. <hi>To call paſſengers that go right on their waies; who ſo is ſimple, let him turn in hither.</hi>] And 22.14. <hi>The mouth of ſtrange women is a deep pit; he that is abborred of the Lord ſhall fall therein.</hi>] For my part, I think he that would not fain know the truth if he could, when it is ſo lovely, and his ſalvation lyeth at the ſlake, is worſe then a mad man: And if I could find that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the way of God, I can boldly ſay, I would quickly own it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt me, (by the help of grace.) But having ſearched into their writings and courſes many a year, I am more and more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that for us to turn to Popery, is to turn from the will of God, from truth to errour, from the way of the Churches unity, to a ſect, from ſafety to exceeding dangere, and from the way of duty to the way of ſin. And of this I am now to give you my reaſons: wherein I will promiſe you as before the Lord to whom I am even going to give an account, that I will not ſpeak againſt my confcience, nor write any thing but what I would write, if this were the laſt day I had to live, as for ought I know, it may be; nor will I charge any thing on them falſly, but undertake before any man breathing, to prove out of their own writings or doings, that it is theirs; though they dare not own it all to the ignorant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Popery is a way of notorious Schiſm, and therefore not the way of God. Papiſts are a very ſect: moſt deſtructive to the unity of the Catholick Church, of any ſect that I know of in the world. They delude the ſimple, that take their words, by telling them that they are the Catholick Church, and that the Chriſtian world is of their minds, when the far greater part of the Chriſtians in the world are ſtrangers or enemies to Popery. The Chriſtians of <hi>Athiopia</hi> and other parts of <hi>Africk,</hi> with all the Greeks, and the reſt in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Proteſtants and others in <hi>Europe,</hi> that diſown them, are far more then the Papiſts. And it is not long ago ſince they were but a few, in compariſon of the reſt of the Chriſtian world: and long after the Apoſtles daies, they were not known up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth. When they were at the higheſt, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had near one half of the Chriſtian world, under their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And yet they muſt needs be the whole Catholick Church: When a part of the Church, will needs be the whole, they make themſelves a ſect. They tell us of the ſmallneſs of our Church, and the greatneſs of theirs; but I muſt profeſs that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not big enough for me to be a member of. The true Catholick Church conſiſteth of all the Chriſtians in the world; of which the Papiſts are but a ſorry corrupted part. That Church that pretendeth to be Catholick and the whole, and yet excludeth the far greater and better part of Chriſtians, is too narrow for me. As the Anabaptiſts ſay, <hi>They</hi> are the Church; and other ſects ſay, <hi>They</hi> are the Church;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170148:3"/>ſo the Papiſts ſay, <hi>They</hi> are the Church: and a defiled piece would ſwallow up the whole. As if the bramble ſhould be taken for all the wood; and the Oak and the Cedar muſt be no part: Or the Oven or the Chimney muſt be all the houſe; or every Cabbin would be the ſhip; or a dirty village would be the whole Common-wealth. Its well for the Papiſts if they prove a part of the univerſal Church; for I am ſure they are Schiſmatical in pretending to be the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. In this Schiſmatical pretence, the Papiſts are notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrilegious, and would rob Chriſt of the greateſt part of his flock, and diſmember the far greateſt part of his body, that they may be taken to be the whole. Hath it coſt Chriſt ſo dear to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a peculiar people to himſelf? <hi>Tilus</hi> 2.14. Hath he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Church with his own blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and now ſhall the ſons of men preſume to rob him of the greateſt part? Is his flock ſo little in all, and will theſe preſumptuous Sectaries make it leſs? If you divide the world into thirty parts, according to the judgement of the beſt Geographers, nineteen of them are Heathens, and ſix are Mahometans, and but five are Chriſtians taking in all ſorts: and yet the Papiſts that are not near half of theſe five, would unchurch all the reſt; as if they envyed Chriſt the fruit of his blood-ſhed. How would their King of <hi>Spain</hi> take it, if they ſhould proclaim that the far greater half of his Dominions is none of his? If Chriſt be ſo tender of every particular ſheep in his flock, that he laid down his life for them, and knows them by name, and none ſhall take them out of his hand, and he that toucheth them doth touch the apple of his eye, <hi>John</hi> 10.3, 15, 27, 28. <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. how then will he take it at the Papiſts hands that would rob him of the greateſt part? But bleſſed be God that judgeth not as they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Herein alſo they are guilty of moſt inhumane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable cruelty; in preſuming to damn the far greateſt part of the Church of Chriſt. If you are ſo ſtraightly charged as to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, <hi>[Judge not that you be not judged,] Mat.</hi> 7.1, 2. And ſo ſharply taken up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. <hi>[Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth;]</hi> What then are they like to hear that will judge to damnation the moſt and the beſt of the Church of God? Perhaps the ignorant of them may ſay, that <hi>All of them are not ſo uncharitable; this is but ſome.</hi> I anſwer, If thou be not of this mind, thou art not a Papiſt; For this is eſſential to that which they call the <hi>Romm Catholick Faith,</hi> to believe that the Catholick Church is only thoſe that are ſubject to the Pope as the Vicar of Chriſt, and Governor of the whole; and that out of this Church, thus headed by the Pope, there is no ſalvation. This is the ſoul of Popery: even as we believe that out of the true Univerſal Church that's headed by Chriſt only, there's no ſalyation. And me
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170148:4"/>thinks, if thou have but the heart of a man, much more of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in thy breaſt, thou ſhouldſt not eaſily believe ſo bloody uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable a Doctrine, as that all the Chriſtian world are damned ſave your ſelves. Doſt thou believe this at thy heart? If not, thou art not of the <hi>Roman</hi> faith: And if thou do, thou haſt little Chriſtian Chanty, and thy deceivers have almoſt taught thee to caſt away the reaſon and the bowels of a man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. And, what a <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>arrogant</hi> way is this? for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed piece of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Catholick Church to ſay, We are the whole? As they in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.5. <hi>[Which ſay, Stand by thy ſelf, come not near to me, for I am holyer then thou.]</hi> To ſay, [<hi>You are all damned Hereticks ſave we, and we only are the Church:</hi> ſuch horrible <hi>Pride</hi> doth not ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Church and Cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. And all this is done by them, againſt the very tenor of the Goſpel; and Covenant of Chriſt; as if it were not enough for them to contradict the Scripture in ſmaller matters, unleſs they gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay the very Promiſe of life, and the Charter of the Saints, and the foundation of our hopes. For it is the ſcope of this Goſpel, that <hi>Whoſoever believeth in Chriſt ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life, John</hi> 3.15, 16, 18. &amp; 1.12. <hi>John</hi> 17.20, 21, 22, 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. &amp; 13.39. &amp; 16.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. &amp; 4.11, 24. &amp; 10.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>John</hi> 16.27. &amp; 20.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.14. <hi>John</hi> 3.36. &amp; 5.24. &amp; 6.35, 40, 47. &amp; 7.38. &amp; 11.25, 26. &amp; 12.46. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. &amp; 9.33. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1, 5, 10. <hi>John</hi> 14.21. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 4.7. An hundred texts might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be cited, where God doth make the moſt peremptory promiſes, that all that believe in Chriſt, and love him, and hope in him, ſhall be ſaved. And yet as if it were in defiance of the Goſpel, the Papiſts make it an Article of their Faith, that no man ſhall be ſaved that becomes not a ſubject of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Let him believe in Chriſt, and love Chriſt, and hope in Chriſt never ſo much; let him believe in the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, yet can he not be ſaved, if he believe not in the Pope. No grace will ſave him; no degree of holineſs will ſave him, that believeth not in the Pope: or at leaſt, none have ſaving Grace, that believe not in him. Wonderful! that it ſhould be poſſible for Chriſtians, for men to be thus beſotted? what muſt become of all thoſe Chriſtians that live many thouſand miles from him, and ſcarce ever heard of his name, and know not whether he be a man or a woman, or whether there be ſuch a place as <hi>Rome</hi> in the world? Muſt they therefore be all damned, as being out of the Church? Why then would not Chriſt have once mentioned to us this Article of our Faith? Why would he never put it in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>[He that obeyeth not the Pope or Roman Church, ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?]</hi> Why was it never in the Churches Creed, <hi>[I believe in the Pope, or Church of Rome]</hi> as well as, <hi>[I believe the Holy Catholick Church?]</hi>

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 6. Moreover the Papiſts cauſe is plainly <hi>carnal,</hi> being all reſolved into a <hi>carnal intereſt,</hi> and maintained by it. The main que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between us, is, Whether the Pope muſt govern all the Chriſtian world, and all perſons muſt obey him upon pain of damnation? And what is this but to exalt a worm, and lay the Kingdom of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulders? If the queſtion were, Whether we ſhould be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or prophane? obey Chriſt or diſobey him? we would be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be behind them? But when all this ſtir is to ſet up one City to be the Miſtreſs of the world, and one man to be the head of the Church, and this without Chriſt and againſt him; what can we think, but that Ambition makes this Lucifer mad?</p>

Moreover, the way of Popery is againſt Chriſtianity, and ſhaketh the very foundation of it, and tempteth the world to infidelity, by building their faith upon an uncertain ground, yea on a ground that is certainly falſe. For according to the Papiſts, we cannot know the Chriſtian Doctrine to be true, nor Scripture to be the Word of God, but on the authority of the Pope or Church? And its as clear as the light, that no man can know that the Pope or Roman Church hath any ſuch authority, till they know the Doctrine of Chriſt to be true, by which they claim it (nor then neither) Who can tell that the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be credited, more then any other Church or perſon, till he find ſome ſuch thing in the Word of God? (which is not there.) And if they do find it there, they cannot believe it, becauſe they receive it not on the authority of the Church. So that if you will be a Papiſt, you muſt hold that the Doctrine of Faith is not to be received, but on the authority of the Roman Church; and yet that the authority of the Roman Church cannot be known but by the Doctrine of Faith (as ſome ſay) Or elſe we muſt ſtay till they prove it by Miracles, as the Apoſtles did (as others ſay.)</p>

And yet they are ſo ſhameleſs, as to call their opinions, the old Religion, and to perſwade the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that we are an upſtart generation, and that our Church is but of two or three hundred years ſtanding, becauſe we have forſaken the Roman novelties, and are turned back to the Primitive Antiquity, For our parts, we ſay, and ſay again, Let him be the ſcorn of the Churches, that believeth any Catholick Church, that is leſs then ſixteen hundred years of continuance! And, Let him be counted a man of no Religion, that is of a Religion that is leſs then ſixteen hundred years old: And what can he expect, but to be accurſt of God, that believeth any Goſpel of leſs then ſixteen hundred years continuance, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. Let us go to the Goſpel, the Records of Antiquity, and ſee there whether our Religion or their opinion be

Where find you that <hi>Jeruſalem, Corinth, Galatia, Philippi,</hi> and all, or any Church in the world, was then commanded to obey the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> or that ever ſhe was called the Miſtreſs of all Churches, or the Univerſal Church. Then <hi>Rome</hi> was but a particular Church like the reſt, and now forſooth it is become the Miſtreſs, and Catholick Church, without obedience to which there is no ſalvation, (if the Pope muſt ſave us.) Where read you that any Apoſtle did direct men to receive the Chriſtian Faith upon the Credit of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Or, When did <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or any Preacher tell the people, [<hi>You muſt believe in</hi> Peter, <hi>or in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>before you can believe in Chriſt;</hi>] Or, <hi>[You muſt believe the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine on the Credit of the Church;]</hi> Or, <hi>[That Church is made the judge of all Controverſies.]</hi> O how many Sermons have we of the Apoſtles and the Fathers, for many hundred years after, and never ſuch a word in them? How many Nations and ſouls converted, and never ſuch an argument uſed with them? How many controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies hotly debated, and never ſuch a remedy propounded.

Moreover, their Profeſſion is much made up of meer contradictions, and the ſubjects of the Pope are ſworn to theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions (at leaſt thoſe in Orders:) By the <hi>Trent</hi> Confeſſion, they are to ſwear that <hi>[They will never take and interpret Scripture, but according to the unanimous conſent of the Fathers.]</hi> And yet they ſwear in the ſame Oath to many particulars which the Fathers were againſt, and many which they never unanimouſly conſented in: They either know not what the Fathers hold, or elſe they know that there's but a ſmall part of the Scripture, or at leaſt far from all, that the Fathers do interpret with unanimous conſent. And there is not one of an hundred or a thouſand of them, that knows what the Fathers do unanimouſly conſent in, and what not; their volumns being ſo many and ſo great, and time ſo ſhort, and moſt ſo idle, or neceſſarily diverted. In abundance of Texts the Fathers differ among themſelves: And here the ſwearers do bind themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to interpret thoſe Scriptures at all, till a Meſſenger from heaven ſhall tell them what the Fathers are agreed on ſince their death. They are ſworn alſo to embrace the ſenſe of their Church: whereas the Fathers and their Church do frequently diſagree: They are ſworn to <hi>[all things delivered, defined, and declared by the Canons, and Occumenical Councils, and this without doubting;]</hi> O ſtrong faith! when even mens faith in Chriſt himſelf is oft mixt with ſuch doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we muſt pray, <hi>[Lord encreaſe our Faith; I believe, help my unbelief.]</hi> Yea, there is not one of a multitude of them that knows what all theſe Canons or Councils do contain.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170148:5"/>they are ſworn to believe them all: The Council at <hi>Conſtance</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that a General Council is above the Pope, and the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> did ſecond them; but the Council of the <hi>Laterane</hi> under <hi>Julius</hi> 2. and <hi>Leo</hi> 10. decree that the Pope is above a General Council. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth add to the Canon of Scripture, contrary to the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> 3. and the Papiſts at this day go contrary to the current judgement of the Church, in adding the Apocryphal Books to the Canon.

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 10. Moreover, Popery is an uncertain Profeſſion, both for the foundation, and the matter of it, the ſenſe and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No man can fully tell what it is, or when he hath it, and when he hath it not. For the foundation of it, their Councils and Nations are yet diſagreed, whether the Pope or General Council be the chief, and which muſt be followed when they diſagree: and which is the infallible Judge of Controverſies. And for the matter, how few in the world can tell what is in all the Canons, and Councils, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and what is their ſenſe: and abundance other uncertainties I have fully manifeſted in my Book againſt Popery, <hi>Disp.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. And for the very Articles of Faith, I have there ſhewed that they are ſtill to them uncertain, whether they have yet all or not: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Pope may make thoſe to be points of faith, as to the people, that were not ſo before; and ſo he may encreaſe them, who knows how much? Every time that the Pope determines a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, he makes us a new Article of faith: As he lately did againſt the <hi>Janſenians:</hi> And how many hundred controverſies are yet to be determined, and conſequently ſo many Articles to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 11. Moreover, Popery is a humane Faith; and not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: It leadeth us but to man, and bottometh us on man: and therefore leaveth us ſhort of God. They muſt firſt believe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine and truth of Scripture, on the authority of the Pope or Church; and then they muſt take the meaning of every word of Scripture upon the credit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Fathers. So that the very upſhot of all their Religion, is, They believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the Word of God, and Chriſt to be the Son of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth tell them ſo? And how know they that this Church is Infallible? Becauſe they ſay ſo themſelves, or becauſe the Scripture ſaith they are infallible, (but who knows where.) But which is the infallible Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> The Pope, ſaith one: A Council ſaith another: A Council confirmed by a Pope, ſaith a third. And how knows the world that theſe are the acts of the Pope, and that he confirmed the Council? Becauſe ſuch a Cardinal, or our Pariſh Prieſt, or a Jeſuit ſaith ſo.

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 12. Popery fets up a Head for the Univerſal Church that cannot poſſibly govern it, and a Center for the Church, in which it cannot poſſibly unite: And ſo it is but a titular Head, and a name and ſhadow, good for nothing but to divide and vex the ſervants of God; but the Uniting and Ruling of them, which is ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, is a flat impoſſibility. It is not morally poſſible to bring all the Chriſtian world, to be of the Popiſh opinion herein, it being a point that is ſo void of cogent evidence from Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they are both againſt it. It is naturally impoſſible for the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the faithful Governor of all the world, if they would conſent. How many years muſt they be travelling or ſailing to <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>Antipodes</hi> or other remote parts of the earth? Moſt of them that had cauſes of Appeal to the Pope, would either be drowned at Sea, or deſtroyed by enemies in the paſſages, or ſpent with travel or Navigation, or waſted with age through the length of their journey: And when they come to him, how inſufficient would the poor man be, to decide all their matters? How many thouſand would be waiting every hour at his Holineſs doors? when he hath leiſure but for a few. How long would it be from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a controverſie to the end, by that time theſe poor men had travelled back again ſo many thouſand miles? And when all the Princes of a great part of the world, are uſually in wars; will they give their ſubjects leave to travail ſo far? and that where the Prince is an enemy to Chriſtianity, as the Turk is? Or would the Princes that he is in war with, give leave to his ſubjects, to paſs through their Dominions? Let us ſee firſt how well an Univerſal Monarch would rule the world by Civil Government, (though yet that is more eaſie) before a ſpiritual Monarch be ſet up.</p>

And worſt of all, this falſe pretended Head and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Churches Unity, doth make our Concord Impoſſible till this Head be taken down. The Papiſts are the greateſt hinderers of the Unity and Concord of Chriſtians, I am confidently perſwaded in all the world! And yet all this miſchief is done to the Church under the pretence of Unity and Concord. What if a ſubject ſhould ſet up himſelf in <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſay, The Prince is abſent, and I am his Deputy, and all are Rebells that unite not in me? Could there be a greater hinderer of Unity then this man? For all that ſubmit to him are Rebells, and all that do not he will endeavor to oppreſs: So is it with the Pope. If we unite in him, we hazard a breaking off from Chriſt; at leaſt, it is ſuch a ſin, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world will never venture on: and if we refuſe it, the Papiſts proclaim us Hereticks, and will have no Peace with us. So that the Church will never have Concord, till this falſe Head be taken off, and Chriſt only be our Head.</p>

They differ in many hundred points, as the writings of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Thomiſts, and Scotiſts, and Ockamiſts, the Dominicans, Franciſcans, and Jeſuites, and other diviſions among them do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. If you ſay, This is not in points of faith. I anſwer, 1. That is as pleaſes the Pope or <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who may make them points of faith at pleaſure. 2. The reaſon why the Pope determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not, is much becauſe his Diſciples are diſagreed about them. 3. They differ in their great fundamental it ſelf, even the ſeat of Supremacy and Infallibility, one part telling us it is the Pope, and the other that it is a General Council. This one differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſurmounteth all the differences of the Reformed Churches, if they were ſet togther. Forſooth, we cannot be Chriſtians, nor know the Scriptures to be the Word of God, but on the Authority of the Church: And when we come to know what the Church is, in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> its one thing, and in <hi>France</hi> another.</p>

They advance the Pope to be the final Judge of Controverſies (or a General Council, as others) and when they have done, they are never the nearer an end of them. He ſeeth many hundred Controverſies among them, and dare not ſpeak a word to determine them. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true expounder of the Scriptures: and yet many hundred differences are known to be among their own Expoſitors, and many hundred Texts that the people underſtand not, and yet this Oracle will not ſpeak; this Judge is as dumb as a fiſh, and leaves us all in as much doubt, and ignorance, and contention, as if we had no Judge? So that all the importunity in the world cannot open his mouth: And yet he learnedly inveighs againſt the Proteſtants that have no Judge of Controverſies. What is it to make fools of men if this be not?</p>

And what a cafe do the Papiſts put the Univerſal Church into, when our faith and the deciſion of our doubts muſt depend upon ſuch a man as abundance of their Popes have been? Many of their own writers call them no better, then Apoſtates, Hereticks, Murderers, Adulterers, Sodomites, Conjurers, and ſuch were the Heads of the Catholick Church, a long time together. I know the ſilly people are told by their lyars, that all this is lyes: But let them put it to the tryal if they dare, whether I will not as fully prove it out of their own writings, as that ever King <hi>William</hi> was alive in <hi>England?</hi> And are condemned Hereticks, and deviliſh Murderers and Adulterers likely to be the infallible Judges of all Controverſies?</p>

Their publick prayers and praiſes of God are performed in a tongue which the people underſtand not. Their writers call it the Original of all Hereſies to tranſlate the Scriptures into a known tongue. And now they are forced at laſt to do it themſelves; they diſſwade the common people from the reading of it. Yea they ſuffer no man to read ſuch a tranſlated Bible, but by a Licenſe from the Ordinary, which any man may know is not ordinarily granted, in their own Dominions. Many a man have they burnt to aſhes, for reading the Bible in a known tongue. And how much they befriend the peoples ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in many other waies, their writings and ſad experience tell us.</p>

Yea, their profeſſion is <hi>contrary</hi> to the light: They preſume to contradict the very Word of God: <hi>Paul</hi> hath written a whole Chapter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. againſt publick praying or prophecying in an unknown tongue: And yet they will uſe it, and make the ſilly people believe, that <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth no ſuch matter as he ſpeaks. How many and many times, is the worſhipping uſe of Images forbidden; And yet they will uſe them, ſay God what he will? How plainly hath Chriſt inſtituted the Lords Supper in both kinds, and how oft is it recited; and they confeſs it was ſo uſed by the antient Church, for many an hundred years. And yet they will preſume to alter all, and to forbid the Cup, even becauſe they will do it. Abundance of ſuch inſtances may be given of their contradicting Scriptures.</p>

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 20. Yea, Popery fighteth with ſenſe and reaſon, and would make men not only mad, but ſenſleſs. For upon pain of damnation, we muſt believe that the Bread in the Sacrament is no Bread, and that the Wine is no Wine: My eyes, and my taſte, and my feeling tell me that it is Bread and Wine, and if I know not Bread and Wine when I ſee it, and touch it, and taſte it, then I muſt be mad or ſenſleſs: And then how can I tell that I know any thing at all. And yet muſt I be here burnt at the ſtake, and hereafter burnt in Hell for ever, if Papiſts be my Judges, unleſs I will believe that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread and Wine is turned into the ſubſtance of the body and blood of Chriſt, and that there is now the colour, and ſmell, and taſte, and quantity of Bread and Wine, without Bread and Wine. The colour which I ſee, and the taſte which I reliſh, are the colour and taſte, Of what? Of nothing. Nor of Bread and Wine. For now there's no ſuch thing. Not of the Body and Blood of Chriſt; for that they deny, and well they may. So that if I know bread and wine when I ſee, and feel, and taſte them; then do I know that Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pery
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170148:7"/>is a deceit: And if I do not, then I know nothing. For if ſenſe deceive us, all deceives us. Moreover it is againſt the knowledge and experience of our own hearts. Popery tells you that none are ſaved or have Charity but Papiſts, becauſe forſooth they are all out of the Church. Here then is an Argument which Chriſtians have in their breaſts, that all the Papiſts on earth cannot anſwer. Look what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of aſſurance you have, that you have Charity or any ſpecial Grace, and ſo much aſſurance you have that Popery is a meer chear, which would perſwade you that none have Charity but Papiſts. If any ſtand not to this cenſure, he is no Papiſt. For if a Proteſtant may have Charity, and be ſaved, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the whole Catholick Church. Yea if you know any Proteſtant on earth that you are perſwaded is a true Chriſtian; you muſt needs be as much perſwaded that Popery is falſe. In the mean time remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this to their credit, that by their own confeſſion never did a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honeſt man turn Papiſt; nor can they deſire any ſuch to turn. So that every man that hath ſaving grace, is ſure.</p>

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 21. Popery doth too much befriend ungodlineſs, to be the way of God. It is fitted to build up the Kingdom of darkneſs. 1. How it befriendeth Ignorance, and fighteth againſt the means of Knowledge, I have toucht before. 2. They make people believe that many of their ſins are but venial, and properly no ſins, againſt no Law, and do not ſo much as deſerve damnation; and therefore they need no Saviour, nor pardon of that puniſhment. 3. Concupiſcence which inclineth men to all actual ſin, they tell them is no ſin in the Baptized, but before it is. 4. Their very frame and courſe of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo formal, that a man would wonder that rational men could approve of it. Such a multitude of ceremonies and hiſtrionical acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inventions of men, do they think to ſerve God with, that one would think they could not make themſelves believe that the moſt wiſe and holy God will regard them. See my Book againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, <hi>pag.</hi> 162, 163. It is againſt the nature of a ſpiritual man, to think ſuch a ſervice ſuitable to God, which is liker a Stage-play or a Morrice-dance. But the Maſs bites not; the profane are well enough pleaſed with this. We find the worſe our people are, the proner are they to ſuch formalities.</p>

I hope well of many among them, but I never had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to meet with a heavenly experienced Chriſtian, that would ſpeak feelingly of the work of the Spirit upon their ſouls, among them all. And almoſt all that ever I was acquainted with, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ignorant. Many of them of no Religion at all; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who Chriſt is, nor very little that a Chriſtian ſhould know: And many of thoſe few that are among us, are of ſcandalous, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170148:8"/>lives: and few have any better then a formal wordy kind of Religiouſneſs; to ſay ſo many prayers, and obſerve ſuch hours and daies, and the like. Look among the common ſort of the Papiſts, and impartially compare their Churches with ours, and ſee whether there be any compariſon to be made in the holineſs of the profeſſors! At <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, the ſeat of his Holineſs, they have large revenues to the Church for the licenſing or permitting of whore-houſes.</p>

They firſt call the conſecrated Bread, the very fleſh of Chriſt it ſelf, and their Lord God; and then they worſhip it as God, and carry it abroad in proceſſion to that end, and command all to worſhip it with Divine worſhip on pain of Damnation. To paſs by their praying to Saints and Angels, and the Idolatrous expreſſions that many of their writers do uſe of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and their ſetting one Saint or other to almoſt all the offices in the world, and filling the world with moſt ridiculous lying ſtories in their Legends, even to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and diſhonour of Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>

O the cruelty that they have exerciſed in the world; the ſtreams of precious blood that they have ſhed; the bone-fires that they have made of holy perſons, when they had firſt perſwaded the world that they were the ſervants of the Devil; and continue to ſlander and blaſpheme them when they are dead! And when we diſcover to the people the moſt palpable of their miſdoings, they make them believe that all that we ſay are lies.

And their Doctrine leadeth not to ſettle the ſoul in a durable well-grounded peace: for they lead men ſo much to their own works, and make ſo light of pardon and reconciliation by the blood of Chriſt; and lead men ſo much to ceremonies, and deny them aſſurance of Juſtification or Salvation, when they have done all, and then deſign them to the flames of Purgatory when they die, (unleſs the Pone will be ſo charitable as to eaſe them) that there is little ſetled Peace of Conſcience to be hoped for that way.</p>

And though their errours are ſo many and ſo great, that moſt Proteſtants take the Pope to be the Antichriſt, yet are they ſo arrogant as to pretend to Perfection, as the Quakers do: Yea to a double perfection: Not only to be perfect without any ſin (but venial, which is none) but alſo to be perfect by works of ſupererogation, and better then ever God Commanded them to be.</p>

            <p>And now I leave it, to the judgement of thoſe that are not willing to be deceived, <hi>Whether the Roman or the Reformed be the truer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, and which of them is liker to be ſaved, and in the ſafer way.</hi> I doubt not but this Paper will be anſwered by ſome body: Its a bad Cauſe indeed that a man of learning can ſay nothing in: But if the ſilly people will be ſatisfied that its anſwered, without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in the anſwer that ſhould ſatisfie a reaſonable man, let them even be deceived, ſeeing they chooſe deceit, and let them take what they get by it.</p>
